  hello:'Welcome',
  comment1:'FREEOS stands for freedom. It is a tool for economic freedom that represents a fairer—more free—alternative to a central bank. It includes—through voting—the freedom to directly determine one’s economic well-being. We call this the Direct Economy.',
  comment2:'FREEOS can be likened to entry to a borderless, globally distributed nation with a policy of Universal Basic Income that comes with two basic conditions: that one has a basic economic stake in the nation, and that one participates in the Direct Economy through voting.',
  comment3:'Through a weekly voting process, each FREEOS citizen participates in an open series of polls, followed by voting on the economic controls of the FREEOS currency. At the end of the vote, any FREEOS minted into existence is evenly distributed to all participants depending on their level of participation',
  comment4:'FREEOS exists to help free us. To take responsibility for our individual economic freedom—as well as our collective freedom. This project intends to provide a tangible mean to help lift ourselves and others up into economic freedom and well-being equally. This version of UBI is not merely a centrally-directed hand-out. It requires responsibility and participation—through a series of questions and votes— making it more of a "hand-in-hand" than a "hand-out".',
  motto:'The Official Airdrop of the Direct Economy',
  rules1: 'The Air Claim exists to jumpstart the FREEOS Economy and to provide a means for participants to gather the entry fee for the upcoming FREEOS voting DAPP. If followed precisely, this claiming process provides double the amount required to participate as a FREEOS citizen. The rest can be given—or sold—to provide the means for others, who may have missed the Air Claim, to enter the FREEOS economy.'
  ,rules2: "For the Air Claim, claiming is done every week and requires a certain minimum amount of coins to be held (HODL) in the user’s account (as listed below). This minimum claim exists to ensure automated scripts (bots) are not written to empty out all of the FREEOS." 
  ,rules3: "Besides the 1st claim, which requires KARMA (designated by the FREEOS team to help prevent bots), all other weeks require 1/2 of the previous claim’s reward to be held by the user before the next claim can be activated. The eventual goal is to have 6000 FREEOS as the entry cost for the 1st full year of FREEOS citizenship.",
