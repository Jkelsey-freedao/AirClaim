  motto:'The Official Airdrop of the Direct Economy',
  rules1: " The Air Claim exists to jumpstart the FREEOS Economy and to provide a means for participants to gather the entry fee for the upcoming FREEOS voting DAPP. If followed precisely, this claiming process provides double the amount required to participate as a FREEOS citizen. The rest can be given—or sold—to provide the means for others, who may have missed the Air Claim, to enter the FREEOS economy."
  ,rules2: "For the Air Claim, claiming is done every week and requires a certain minimum amount of coins to be held (HODL) in the user’s account (as listed below). This minimum claim exists to ensure automated scripts (bots) are not written to empty out all of the FREEOS." 
  ,rules3: "Besides the 1st claim, which requires KARMA (designated by the FREEOS team to help prevent bots), all other weeks require 1/2 of the previous claim’s reward to be held by the user before the next claim can be activated. The eventual goal is to have 6000 FREEOS as the entry cost for the 1st full year of FREEOS citizenship."
